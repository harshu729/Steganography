@ Contributing:
===============
Please feel free to submit issues and pull requests. We appreciate bug reports. I have tested it on Linux and Windows Platform.




@ Note:
=======
	1. Coding Language: Python3
	2. All Input Files should be in the Same Project Folder.
	3. Steganographed Image will be produced in the Same Project Folder only.




@ Steganography:
================
	A Python compression and decompression program based on Steganography (LSB).


	# Introduction
	This project is to design compression and decompression programs based on Steganography. The Idea of Steganography is the practice of hiding private or sensitive information within something that appears to be nothing out to the usual. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. Generally, the hidden information is a text message or image data.


	## Setting up the Environment
	Create a `virtualenv` and install the requirements:
		virtualenv venv
		source venv/bin/activate
		pip install -r requirements.txt
	

	### Encode
		1. Open steg.py in your Preferred Python3 Console.
		2. Enter details of Input picture in the Console.
		3. Enter Secret Data in the console when asked.


	#### Decode
		1. Open steg.py in your Preferred Python3 Console.
		2. Enter details of Steganographed Picture in the Console.
		3. You'll Get the Secret Message in the Console.
